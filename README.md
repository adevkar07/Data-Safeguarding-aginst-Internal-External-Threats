# Data-Safeguarding-aginst-Internal-External-Threats

Today, many organisations use Information Systems to manage their sensitive and critical business related information. The need to
protect such a key component of the organisation, and avoid data theft cannot be overemphasised. Data theft can be defined as the act of stealing
computer-based information from an unknowing victim with the intent of compromising privacy or obtaining confidential information. The
project deals with the safeguarding of data against internal as well as external threats. The internal threats in this
project deal with leakage of data from within an organisation by the means of mountable devices such as USB drives, while the external threats
that are considered are those that corrupt data and cause its loss by means of ransomware attacks. Ransomware is malware for data kidnapping,
an exploit in which the attacker encrypts the victim's data and demands payment for the decryption key. This paper describes the ways to thwart
such external attacks by monitoring a set of folders for early detection of ransomware. On the other hand, internal threats are handling by means
of encrypting data while transferring it over USB drives and other mountable devices.
